# Practice Android projects
Android is an open source software stack provided by [Google](www.google.com). It uses **JAVA** as its first-class programming language. Anyone can use **C, C++, Groove** and some other languages to develop androi application \(aka **APK**\). To use **C and C++** programming language one have to gain the knowledge of java native interface programming as android uses **NDK** to support **C and C++**. Android is a powerfull platform now and it will be in future. There are a lot of scopes in the software developer world for android developer. I am going to hosting my Practice projects under this repository.
